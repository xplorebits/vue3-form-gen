Building and managing forms in web applications can often be a cumbersome process. VueFormBuilder seeks to streamline this process by providing developers with a robust set of tools to create dynamic, flexible, and user-friendly forms. Inspired by the intuitive design of popular form-building platforms, VueFormBuilder incorporates features like drag-and-drop reordering and JSON schema generation, all within the powerful Vue 3 ecosystem.

- **JSON Schema Generation**: Generate and export a JSON schema of your form for easy storage, transfer, and reusability.
